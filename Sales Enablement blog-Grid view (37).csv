,,"Amplemarket amplemarket.com @amplemarket The pandemic was a catalyst for remote sales motions. It’s not uncommon to see enterprise account executives close multi-million dollar deals without ever meeting the buyer in person. This highlights the importance of a sales stack easy to implement, learn & manage; individual reps need the tools necessary to hit their quota, & managers need to have visibility into what’s happening across their teams without being able to be physically next to their teams on a daily basis. Most sales teams need to stitch together a variety of point solutions to execute their sales motions. Amplemarket can replace a number of those across a few different categories. It was launched in 2019 by MIT alumnus. Originating from Portugal, the 3 founders saw firsthand the challenges of scaling B2B sales in other companies & realized existing point solutions don’t address core problems. The excessive fragmentation of the present-day sales stack combined with recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) set up the opportunity for an all-in-one compound solution that can leverage the virtuous data cycles of having a central system of action. Sales teams have more SaaS subscriptions than they know what to do with, leading to friction & added operational complexity. They designed Amplemarket to rally different pieces of the B2B sales process around a single prospect versus a collection of siloed, disparate tools. Email deliverability is probably one of the most important problems that go-to-market teams have to deal with when doing B2B sales. Email deliverability is a complex multivariate problem & a lot of the things companies did 5 years ago to keep a healthy deliverability aren’t enough. Better Deliverability -> More Sales Conversations -> Increased Sales Pipeline -> More New Customers -> More Revenue! For B2B companies improving their top of the funnel, engaging with more prospects translates directly into more revenue at the bottom of the funnel. So, really, for sales teams: Deliverability = Revenue!

They saw sell-side users often sharing one-directional, static sales decks that failed to garner responses / feedback. Through an effort to understand how their buy-side users engage with sales material in the marketplace, the company developed tools to track interactions with their own sales decks to their users. “In our effort to solve a problem in the media RFP space, we discovered a problem in the sales space. When we thought we were solving a problem for our users, we ended up solving a problem for sales people in general. Sometimes great products come out of internal tools that can be applied externally […].” The DeckLinks platform is capable of showing sales reps how buyers specifically interact with sales materials, even when no direct response is provided. Allows sales teams to start more conversations with relevant follow ups, access actionable insights to improve their efforts, & close more deals by personalizing client experiences. Goes beyond traditional document sharing platforms by creating a custom, fully-trackable microsite that houses each deck.

With the playbook in place, reps can answer customer questions on competition, pricing, & new product capabilities quickly. The more you use it, the better it gets by using deep learning from daily interactions. Inside sales is growing because of the way consumers & businesses now interact with technology.

In most cases, they make the first contact. Whether it is through email, chat or a phone call, this contact is made to an inside sales rep.

Through an effort to understand how their buy-side users engage with sales material in the marketplace, the company developed tools to track interactions with their own sales decks to their users. “In our effort to solve a problem in the media RFP space, we discovered a problem in the sales space. When we thought we were solving a problem for our users, we ended up solving a problem for sales people in general. Sometimes great products come out of internal tools that can be applied externally […].” The DeckLinks platform is capable of showing sales reps how buyers specifically interact with sales materials, even when no direct response is provided. Allows sales teams to start more conversations with relevant follow ups, access actionable insights to improve their efforts, & close more deals by personalizing client experiences.
