Save 10+ hrs / week with Duo’s daily signals, in-depth research, & multichannel outreach. San Francisco, California, USA. Tagis Inc. The pandemic was a catalyst for remote sales motions. It’s not uncommon to see enterprise account executives close multi-million dollar deals without ever meeting the buyer in person. This highlights the importance of a sales stack easy to implement, learn & manage; individual reps need the tools necessary to hit their quota, & managers need to have visibility into what’s happening across their teams without being able to be physically next to their teams on a daily basis. Most sales teams need to stitch together a variety of point solutions to execute their sales motions. Amplemarket can replace a number of those across a few different categories. It was launched in 2019 by MIT alumnus. Originating from Portugal, the 3 founders saw firsthand the challenges of scaling B2B sales in other companies & realized existing point solutions don’t address core problems. The excessive fragmentation of the present-day sales stack combined with recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) set up the opportunity for an all-in-one compound solution that can leverage the virtuous data cycles of having a central system of action. Sales teams have more SaaS subscriptions than they know what to do with, leading to friction & added operational complexity. They designed Amplemarket to rally different pieces of the B2B sales process around a single prospect versus a collection of siloed, disparate tools. Email deliverability is probably one of the most important problems that go-to-market teams have to deal with when doing B2B sales. Email deliverability is a complex multivariate problem & a lot of the things companies did 5 years ago to keep a healthy deliverability aren’t enough. Better Deliverability -> More Sales Conversations -> Increased Sales Pipeline -> More New Customers -> More Revenue! For B2B companies improving their top of the funnel, engaging with more prospects translates directly into more revenue at the bottom of the funnel. So, really, for sales teams: Deliverability = Revenue! San Francisco, California, USA.

,BriefBid Inc.,"BriefBid briefbid.com @briefbid launched DeckLinks (See DeckLinks) a platform that helps sales teams share interactive sales decks & access instant analytics on buyer engagement; positioning DeckLinks as Google Analytics for sales decks. It offers analytics for deck sharing & is a new stand-alone product that was inspired by key-learnings from the BriefBid’s B2B marketplace, which serves media buyers & sellers through RFP management & matchmaking. They saw sell-side users often sharing one-directional, static sales decks that failed to garner responses / feedback. Through an effort to understand how their buy-side users engage with sales material in the marketplace, the company developed tools to track interactions with their own sales decks to their users. “In our effort to solve a problem in the media RFP space, we discovered a problem in the sales space. When we thought we were solving a problem for our users, we ended up solving a problem for sales people in general. Sometimes great products come out of internal tools that can be applied externally […].” The DeckLinks platform is capable of showing sales reps how buyers specifically interact with sales materials, even when no direct response is provided. Allows sales teams to start more conversations with relevant follow ups, access actionable insights to improve their efforts, & close more deals by personalizing client experiences. Goes beyond traditional document sharing platforms by creating a custom, fully-trackable microsite that houses each deck. Features include company profiles, industry-specific modules, & other widgets.

Provides interactive guides, proven playbooks, & smart objection handling, helping them to structure their phone conversations & increase their success & productivity. With the best questions & best answers during your sales calls Ciara makes you an inside sales rockstar – right away. Outside sales is still around, but compared to inside sales it is trending down. Ciara will be able to understand a conversation in full & will provide real-time sales enablement skills to inside sales reps. Sales professionals spend just 34% of their time selling. They spend the rest of their time with data entry, quote generation, & other tasks. And these tasks keep them away from customers. The Ciara platform is being driven by the success of AI & real-time communications currently used by virtual assistants. With the playbook in place, reps can answer customer questions on competition, pricing, & new product capabilities quickly. The more you use it, the better it gets by using deep learning from daily interactions. Inside sales is growing because of the way consumers & businesses now interact with technology. When someone wants to buy a product or service, the first thing they do is search for it online. By the time they have made the decision to buy, they have all the information they need. In most cases, they make the first contact. Whether it is through email, chat or a phone call, this contact is made to an inside sales rep. How the rep responds will dictate if the customer is going to move forward with the purchase. This highlights the importance of proper training & having the right tools in place. Founded Date: 2019. Munich, Germany. Ciara joins forces with Unique! 11-Apr-2022, Unique acquired Ciara for an undisclosed amount.

Sales Enablement + Customer Enablement = Revenue Enablement! Expanding the scope of sales enablement to include customer facing roles as well as the customer. Why enable customer facing roles & the customer directly? Research from Gartner supports the need: The sales enablement market has broadened beyond sellers to include the enablement of people in revenue-generating roles such as customer success, presales & marketing. An individual sales rep may often receive only 5% of a prospect’s direct time. 60% of frontline sales enablement companies are predicted to shift to enabling additional customer-facing roles over the next three years. By 2025, 25% of organizations will create a formal cross-functional counsel to align customer-facing teams that will provide recommendations, governance & oversight across the entire revenue process. Remove silos, become customer centric, and eliminate the fluff. Do not wait to drive the latest evolution of enablement. Onboarding the first product purchased by the customer is only the beginning.

It offers analytics for deck sharing & is a new stand-alone product that was inspired by key-learnings from the BriefBid’s B2B marketplace, which serves media buyers & sellers through RFP management & matchmaking. They saw sell-side users often sharing one-directional, static sales decks that failed to garner responses / feedback. Through an effort to understand how their buy-side users engage with sales material in the marketplace, the company developed tools to track interactions with their own sales decks to their users. “In our effort to solve a problem in the media RFP space, we discovered a problem in the sales space. When we thought we were solving a problem for our users, we ended up solving a problem for sales people in general. Sometimes great products come out of internal tools that can be applied externally […].” The DeckLinks platform is capable of showing sales reps how buyers specifically interact with sales materials, even when no direct response is provided. Allows sales teams to start more conversations with relevant follow ups, access actionable insights to improve their efforts, & close more deals by personalizing client experiences. Goes beyond traditional document sharing platforms by creating a custom, fully-trackable microsite that houses each deck.

Gather’s CoAudiences helps lifestyle brands reduce Customer Acquisition Costs, by unlocking partner channels and extending audience reach to consumers who have shown purchase intent. It’s been tough for many DTC & ecommerce brands recently. Marketing and acquisition costs have risen significantly over the past few years. It has gotten harder to keep a good ROI. When a customer demonstrates purchase intent with a brand, they’re a great fit for a complementary partner brand. Complementary brands are brands who often collaborate or co-market, since they share similar types of audiences. For example, this could be protein bar brand and a gym brand. However, we noticed working with many Lifestyle brands over the years that collaborations are tedious to implement and are too time consuming. Things like generating discount codes in bulk for a partner brand’s audience, tracking results really take the fun out of the process. Marketing collaborations offer brands a very low cost acquisition channel. But it’s the admin side of things that gets in the way of the ROI. That’s where we come in. We’ve built a platform that makes things like coupon code sharing, attribution and results tracking a breeze, putting the fun back into collabs. If this is an interesting proposition, we’d love to invite you to learn more and share with ecommerce folks who may be interested to join the CoAudiences directory.

Buyers aren’t looking for sellers to present static, boring pitch decks with product information they’ve already found online.

Content Hub & the suite of sales enablement & content management solutions positions Mediafly as a sales enablement technology provider to support the entire buyer journey in one platform, enabling a consistent, personalized & engaging sales content experience from a buyer’s first interaction with a brand through to conversion & post-sale. The typical B2B buyer is already 57% through the purchase process before reaching out to sales. This makes the content that buyers self-discover online a critical component of the sales process. To win attention / new customers, companies must offer a consistent, premium, end-to-end sales content experience that guides a buyer from education to purchase. This flow is typically obstructed by sales & marketing content housed in disparate, non-communicative systems that fail to leverage the collective insights that guide buyers toward confident purchase decisions.
