Save 10+ hrs / week with Duo’s daily signals, in-depth research, & multichannel outreach. San Francisco, California, USA. Tagis Inc. The pandemic was a catalyst for remote sales motions. It’s not uncommon to see enterprise account executives close multi-million dollar deals without ever meeting the buyer in person. This highlights the importance of a sales stack easy to implement, learn & manage; individual reps need the tools necessary to hit their quota, & managers need to have visibility into what’s happening across their teams without being able to be physically next to their teams on a daily basis. Most sales teams need to stitch together a variety of point solutions to execute their sales motions. Amplemarket can replace a number of those across a few different categories. It was launched in 2019 by MIT alumnus. Originating from Portugal, the 3 founders saw firsthand the challenges of scaling B2B sales in other companies & realized existing point solutions don’t address core problems. The excessive fragmentation of the present-day sales stack combined with recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) set up the opportunity for an all-in-one compound solution that can leverage the virtuous data cycles of having a central system of action. Sales teams have more SaaS subscriptions than they know what to do with, leading to friction & added operational complexity. They designed Amplemarket to rally different pieces of the B2B sales process around a single prospect versus a collection of siloed, disparate tools. Email deliverability is probably one of the most important problems that go-to-market teams have to deal with when doing B2B sales. Email deliverability is a complex multivariate problem & a lot of the things companies did 5 years ago to keep a healthy deliverability aren’t enough. Better Deliverability -> More Sales Conversations -> Increased Sales Pipeline -> More New Customers -> More Revenue! For B2B companies improving their top of the funnel, engaging with more prospects translates directly into more revenue at the bottom of the funnel. So, really, for sales teams: Deliverability = Revenue! San Francisco, California, USA.

They saw sell-side users often sharing one-directional, static sales decks that failed to garner responses / feedback. Through an effort to understand how their buy-side users engage with sales material in the marketplace, the company developed tools to track interactions with their own sales decks to their users. “In our effort to solve a problem in the media RFP space, we discovered a problem in the sales space. When we thought we were solving a problem for our users, we ended up solving a problem for sales people in general. Sometimes great products come out of internal tools that can be applied externally […].” The DeckLinks platform is capable of showing sales reps how buyers specifically interact with sales materials, even when no direct response is provided. Allows sales teams to start more conversations with relevant follow ups, access actionable insights to improve their efforts, & close more deals by personalizing client experiences.

Outreach content for: Emails, LinkedIn Messages, LinkedIn Connection Requests, Call Scripts, & To-Dos. CallSine employs LLMs to generate personalized messages for sales teams. Most sales engagement tools fail because they don’t actually understand your company – even if they “use” AI. Real personalization requires a system that can relate specific, relevant points about your company to different prospects based on their company’s initiatives, their role, recent news, or even their LinkedIn activity. Sales engagement is broken! Generic outreach isn’t working. Prospects can see through templated messages, & current tools only encourage shortcuts. It’s time for something better—something that lets you do the job right, without sacrificing efficiency. CallSine is different; Simplifies the complex tasks of sales outreach—prospecting across LinkedIn, email, & calls, all while managing contacts & tracking success in one place. CallSine’s unique approach, leveraging its patent-pending Agentic AI technology, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), & advanced personalization capabilities, positions it at the forefront of this industry transformation. CallSine’s platform goes beyond the limitations of static CRM systems by enabling hyper-personalized, real-time outreach that resonates with clients across multiple channels.

They saw sell-side users often sharing one-directional, static sales decks that failed to garner responses / feedback. Through an effort to understand how their buy-side users engage with sales material in the marketplace, the company developed tools to track interactions with their own sales decks to their users. “In our effort to solve a problem in the media RFP space, we discovered a problem in the sales space. When we thought we were solving a problem for our users, we ended up solving a problem for sales people in general. Sometimes great products come out of internal tools that can be applied externally […].” The DeckLinks platform is capable of showing sales reps how buyers specifically interact with sales materials, even when no direct response is provided. Allows sales teams to start more conversations with relevant follow ups, access actionable insights to improve their efforts, & close more deals by personalizing client experiences. Goes beyond traditional document sharing platforms by creating a custom, fully-trackable microsite that houses each deck.

Gather’s CoAudiences helps lifestyle brands reduce Customer Acquisition Costs, by unlocking partner channels and extending audience reach to consumers who have shown purchase intent. It’s been tough for many DTC & ecommerce brands recently. Marketing and acquisition costs have risen significantly over the past few years. It has gotten harder to keep a good ROI. When a customer demonstrates purchase intent with a brand, they’re a great fit for a complementary partner brand. Complementary brands are brands who often collaborate or co-market, since they share similar types of audiences. For example, this could be protein bar brand and a gym brand. However, we noticed working with many Lifestyle brands over the years that collaborations are tedious to implement and are too time consuming. Things like generating discount codes in bulk for a partner brand’s audience, tracking results really take the fun out of the process. Marketing collaborations offer brands a very low cost acquisition channel. But it’s the admin side of things that gets in the way of the ROI. That’s where we come in. We’ve built a platform that makes things like coupon code sharing, attribution and results tracking a breeze, putting the fun back into collabs. If this is an interesting proposition, we’d love to invite you to learn more and share with ecommerce folks who may be interested to join the CoAudiences directory.

The point of the app was to enable users to easily tweak their story lines for any given presentation & to change tack in the middle of that same meeting. Founded in Poland by a group of advertising vets, the idea was that there is no better way to achieve credibility with a client than to deliver a customized pitch. The app placed product images on cards, which the salesperson could shuffle, group, & swipe away in reaction to the client’s responses: More agile than slideshow programs, especially relevant when appealing to only a few people’s opinions. In addition to programs like PowerPoint & Keynote, it was directly competing against customizable sales apps like Showpad/StoryDesk.

These takeaways are shared with team members, empowering them to tap into the lessons learned in relevant situations & increase their success rate in future deals. Automating the win/loss analysis process ensures it gets done every time & gives the team the tools they need to be successful for the next deal. Also makes sure salespeople have the information of what works & doesn’t work in the sales process, improving closing rates by continuously updating the team in real-time. Eliminating missed opportunities to close deals: The sales team platform efficiently integrates learning from past experiences into the day-to-day work process of its customers. The automated win/loss analysis adds immediate feedback & creates valuable opportunities to learn at the moment of need. It will improve an important sales process & the opportunities to close deals successfully. Powered by AI, the platform integrates with Salesforce & other CRM systems to deliver real-time sales guidance, increase visibility for managers, & foster strong team collaboration. Shamaym, Inc.
